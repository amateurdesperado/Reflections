Using remote repositories can come quite handy when working together on a project,
or working from different PCs

pulling changes manually allows u to control what do u wanna modify,
i.e. when some dude is working on a different part of ur project, and u do not
need his changes yet

forks VS clones VS branches
fork: between two GitHub repositories, mostly when u can't modify the rep u clone
clone: everyting can be cloned
branch: u can push and pull them and a lot of other tings

issa cool ting to store a copy of the remote branch locally, like u know what
u been up to and the other person who modified the code has his version,
so u get new shit when merging the 2 versions

It's easier to collaborate with others on GitHub,
cause it's possible to edit code and leave comments simultaneously,
however if there ain't no GitHub there ain't no need to merge different
remote branches

first thing: linux is amazing
commands learned:
    diff -u file1 file2 #find the differences between two files line by line
    pwd #print working directory

accessing the history of a file is the real shit #use it bitch

git commit - manually commit the version of ur code
pros: u do that whenever u need to, like after a logical change
cons: u do it manually, its doesn't backup like google docs

git can save multiple files in one commit

commands learned:
    git log #returns history of the commits in a repository
    run diff on the id of the commits

open file in a browser: google-chrome index.html

using version control actually helps a lot, like u can go and do crazy shit,
then u go git checkout [commit id] and test the living  shit to pinpoint the
commit, where the bug was first introduced

the clone bug id: 746f762e38b5bbb7d0b837464ef6ec3f8ee5bf91
